A grief-stricken elderly man, who recently lost his wife of many years, breaks a number of laws in order to fly his house to another continent in order to fulfill one of his wifeâ€™s dying wishes. To make matters worse, he also kidnaps a precocious young boy and endangers both of their lives when he seeks out his childhood hero, who is revealed to be a senile, gun-toting psychopath. 
The elderly man finds himself lost in the sweltering jungle of Paradise Falls, a brutal and unforgiving region of South America, where he is forced to listen to the complaints of his aching joints and of the young boy. The annoyances continue to stack up once a mysterious talking dog and flamboyant bird join their ragtag group. However, the elderly man finds himself enjoying their company, and even relying on them to save him from his demented childhood hero.
